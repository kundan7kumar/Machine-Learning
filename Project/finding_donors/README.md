# Finding Donors for CharityML

Investigated factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency.
### Prerequisites

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer.

### Installation

A step by step tells how to get a development env running.

First step is to create virtual environment

```
python -m pip install --user virtualenv
```

And then create virtual environment

```
python -m virtualenv finding_donors
```
Now activate virtual environment

```
source env/bin/activate
```
In the virtual environment,install the packages mentioned above.

```
pip install numpy pandas 
```
Install the more packages in the virtual Environment.

```
python -mpip install matplotlib
```
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
```
python -m pip install jupyter
```
Also, You can install ananconda which has packages inbuilt to it.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the  project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data
The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
