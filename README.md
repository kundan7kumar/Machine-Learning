# Machine-Learning

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program 

  - It contains supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning and Deep Learning.
  - Courses include lecture videos, quizzes and programming problems. These courses were developed by Georgia Tech, Udacity, Google and Kaggle.
  -   Six projects.

# Projects Outline!

  - Exploratory Project: Titanic Survival Exploration Model Evaluation and Validation
  - Predicting Boston Housing Prices Supervised Learning
  - Finding Donors for CharityML
  - Indentifying Customers by Clustering them
  - Train a Smartcab to Drive (Implement Q-learning algorithm)
  Classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consisted of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The project involed preprocessing the images, then training a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images needed to be normalized and the labels had to be one-hot encoded. Built convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers and see the neural network's predictions on the sample images.
