# Machine-Learning

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program 

  - It contains supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning and Deep Learning.
  - Courses include lecture videos, quizzes and programming problems. These courses were developed by Georgia Tech, Udacity, Google and Kaggle.
  -   Six projects.

## Projects!
#### 1.  Titanic Survival Exploration Model Evaluation and Validation
##### Project Description
In this project, we will explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive.
